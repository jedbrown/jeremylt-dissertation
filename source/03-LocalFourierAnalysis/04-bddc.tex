Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints is a relatively new technique created by Dohrmann in 2003 \cite{dohrmann2003preconditioner}.
BDDC is an improvement upon balancing domain decomposition (BDD) \cite{mandel1993balancing}, which requires modifications for high-order problems.
The dual primal version of finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI-DP) \cite{farhat2000scalable} is closely related to BDDC and the two are effectively the same technique, under certain assumptions \cite{mandel2007bddc}.

LFA of BDDC was introduced by Brown, He, and MacLachlan \cite{brown2019local}.
We will re-derive the LFA of BDDC in the context of high-order elements, with single element and marco-element subdomains.
