High-order finite elements implemented in a matrix-free fashion are one way to address the memory bandwidth bottlenecks for modern HPC hardware.
In this chapter, we consider the performance constraints of modern HPC hardware and provide a representation of high-order finite elements that facilitates matrix-free implementation.

In Section \ref{sec:highorderwhy} we explore the benefits of high-order matrix-free methods on modern hardware.
In Section \ref{sec:highordernotation} we develop notation to describe high-order matrix-free finite elements on unstructured meshes.
