High-order finite elements implemented in a matrix-free fashion are one way to address the memory bandwidth bottlenecks for modern HPC hardware.
In section \ref{01-why} we explore the benefits of high-order matrix-free methods on modern hardware, and in section \ref{02-notation} we develop notation to describe high-order matrix-free finite elements on unstructured meshes.
This notation is applicable to arbitrary second order linear and nonlinear PDEs.
