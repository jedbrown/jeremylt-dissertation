Direct solver techniques such as sparse LU factorization or Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) are not available for high-order finite element operators implemented in a matrix-free fashion, as the these techniques require an assembled matrix, which defeats the purpose of using matrix-free implementations.
In this section, we will discuss iterative solver techniques for linear and linearized problems and the importance of preconditioning for these techniques.
