High-order finite elements implemented in a matrix-free fashion are one way to address the hardware constraints for modern high performance computing (HPC) systems.
In this chapter, we consider the performance bottlenecks of modern HPC hardware and demonstrate that high-order matrix-free finite element discretizations address these constraints to help application codes best utilize modern hardware.

In Section \ref{sec:highorderwhy} we explore the limitations of modern HPC hardware and in Section \ref{sec:highorderbenefits} we discuss the benefits of high-order matrix-free methods on modern HPC hardware.
In Section \ref{sec:highordernotation} we develop notation to describe high-order finite element discretizations for arbitrary second order PDEs implemented in a matrix-free fashion on unstructured meshes.
In Section \ref{sec:highordersolvers} we discuss iterative solvers for matrix-free methods as well as the importance of preconditioning high-order finite element operators for the convergence of these solvers.
Finally, in Section \ref{sec:libceedapplications} we provide some examples of practical applications with libCEED that demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of this matrix-free representation with these preconditioned iterative solvers for real-world problems.
