LFA provides a tool to analyze and predict the convergence of preconditioning techniques for finite element and finite difference methods.
LFA \cite{brandt1977multi} was originally developed in the context of analyzing h-multigrid methods for finite difference methods, but since then LFA has been used to analyze finite element methods and a variety of preconditioning techniques.
Our development of LFA of p-multigrid is a novel addition to the field.

In this chapter, we introduce the notation required to describe LFA of high-order finite elements.
In Section \ref{sec:lfahighorder} we develop the notation for LFA of high-order finite element methods using the matrix-free notation from Chapter \ref{ch:HighOrderFEM}.
This notation is used to develop LFA of smoothers for high-order finite element operators in Section \ref{sec:lfasmoothers}.
This notation will be used in Chapter \ref{ch:DomainDecomposition} and Chapter \ref{ch:MultigridMethods} to analyze the performance of matrix-free implementations of Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints and Multigrid preconditioners for high-order finite element methods.
