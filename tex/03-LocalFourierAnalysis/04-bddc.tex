Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints is a relatively new technique created by Dohrmann in 2003 \cite{dohrmann2003preconditioner}.
BDDC is an improvement upon balancing domain decomposition (BDD) \cite{mandel1993balancing}, which requires modifications to be effective for high-order problems, especially for three-dimensional problems.
The dual primal version of finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI-DP) \cite{farhat2000scalable} is closely related to BDDC and the two are effectively the same technique, under certain assumptions \cite{mandel2007bddc}.

LFA of BDDC was introduced by Brown, He, and MacLachlan \cite{brown2019local}.
We will re-derive the LFA of BDDC in the context of high-order elements, with single element and marco-element subdomains.

Domain decomposition techniques decompose the domain $\Omega$ into a series of subdomains $\Omega_i$.
Some techniques use overlapping subdomains, such as additive Schwartz methods, which are popular for high-order and spectral finite elements \cite{fischer1997overlapping} and have been used as smoothers in multigrid methods \cite{fischer2005hybrid}.
In BDDC, we instead use non-overlapping subdomains with an interface given by $\Gamma = \bigcup \partial \Omega_i \backslash \partial \Omega$.
Each subdomain interface is defined by $\Gamma_i = \Gamma \bigcap \partial \Omega_i$.
