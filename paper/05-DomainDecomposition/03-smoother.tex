Jacobi and Chebyshev smoothers provided rather poor convergence factors for $p$-multigrid with aggressive coarsening.
In this section, we explore using BDDC on single high-order element subdomains as a smoother for $p$-multigrid.

Given the ill-conditioning seen in Figure \ref{fig:lumped_bddc_comparison} for the lumped BDDC preconditioned operator with single high-order element subdomains, we restrict our analysis to Dirichlet BDDC.
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:fdm_subdomain}, the higher setup cost associated with Dirichlet BDDC for subdomains consisting of multiple low-order elements can be eliminated with the use of FDM approximate solvers for the broken subdomain and subdomain interior problems.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:unrelaxed_bddc} we see the symbol of the error operator for Dirichlet BDDC, given by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{E}} \left( \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) = \mathbf{I} - \tilde{\mathbf{M}}_2^{-1} \tilde{{\color{burgundy}A}} \left( \boldsymbol{\theta} \right),
\end{equation}
for the two dimensional Laplacian
This error operator has a spectral radius greater than one, indicating that the Dirichlet BDDC preconditioner as described above may not be an appropriate smoother for $p$-multigrid.

However, if we introduce a relaxation parameter, $\omega$, as used in the Jacobi preconditioner, then we see an improved spectral radius in Figure \ref{fig:relaxed_bddc} for the error operator.
The symbol of the error operator with a relaxation parameter is given by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{E}} \left( \boldsymbol{\theta}, \omega \right) = \mathbf{I} - \omega \tilde{\mathbf{M}}_2^{-1} \tilde{{\color{burgundy}A}} \left( \boldsymbol{\theta} \right).
\end{equation}

\caption{Two-grid convergence factor for $p$-multigrid with BDDC smoother for 2D Laplacian}
\label{table:two_grid_bddc_smoother}
\end{table}

In Table \ref{table:two_grid_bddc_smoother}, we see the two-grid convergence factor for $p$-multigrid with the weighted Dirichlet BDDC smoother for the two dimensional Laplacian.
When compared to Table \ref{table:two_grid_2d_chebyshev}, we can see that the weighted Dirichlet BDDC smoother provides a significantly improved two-grid convergence factor for aggressive coarsening with high-order elements when compared to fourth order Chebyshev smoothing.
Additionally, the weighted Dirichlet BDDC smoother provides analogous two-grid convergence factors when compared to more conservative coarsening strategies with second or third order Chebyshev smoothing.
