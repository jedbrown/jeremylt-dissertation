Multigrid methods are popular multi-level techniques that provide resolution independent convergence rates.
$p$-type multigrid, developed by Ronquist and Patera \cite{ronquist1987spectral}, is a natural choice for high-order finite elements on an unstructured mesh and can be implemented with operators represented as in Equation \ref{eq:libceed_representation}.
Ronquist and Patera declared $p$-multigrid \textit{sensibly independent} of the number of elements and polynomial degree of the element bases.

There has been work by Heys, Manteuffel, McCormick, and Olson demonstrating the feasibility of algebraic multigrid (AMG) for high-order finite elements \cite{heys2005algebraic}; however, AMG requires assembly of the finite element operator, which defeats the benefits of matrix-free implementation.
In a recent publication, Davydow et al. use $h$-multigrid for matrix-free finite elements in solid mechanics; however $p$-multigrid can offer more flexibility with respect to meshes in comparison to $h$-multigrid as it does not require aggregation of multiple elements into larger elements.

In this chapter we introduce LFA of $p$-multigrid and generalize this analysis to reproduce previous work on $h$-multigrid.
We provide initial convergence factors for agressive coarsening with Jacobi and Chebyshev semi-iterative smoothers as a baseline to compare with BDDC smoothing.
